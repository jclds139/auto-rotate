# auto-rotate

This script allows a convertible tablet to work
for auto-rotation. It causes all pointers to also
rotate orientation and disables any touchpads outside
of normal orientation.

It disables itself if there is an external display 
attached.

The install script will setup the systemd and
set the path. Adding the parameter '-u' to it will uninstall it.
